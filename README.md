## What Are These Notes Used For?

This is the inspection note templates used by State of Arizona inspectors when auditing facilities that utilize x-rays.

For inspectors, they provide an improved template on which to take notes during inspections. At the bottom of each page is a button for each type of x-ray unit which could be encountered. Clicking on one of the buttons at the bottom of the fourth page will spawn a new page with the corresponding note sheet for that unit type. [Arizona Administrative Code](https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/licensing/radiation-regulatory/rules/rules-aac-9-7.pdf) ("A.A.C.") references are provided for the inspector.

For facilities, they serve as both an outline of what to expect when a being audited as well as a method to conduct internal audits for maintaining compliance between State inspections. Each item on the template is accompanied by its corresponding A.A.C. regulation, for reference and more information.
